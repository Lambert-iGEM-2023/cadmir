      "The miRNA-33 pathway is involved in regulating autophagy, lysosomal function, and lipid homeostasis. It works by repressing multiple genes with related functions, including genes involved in autophagy and lipid metabolism. The pathway is regulated by miR-33 and its passenger strand miR-33*, which both contribute to the inhibitory activity of the pathway. In the context of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, Mtb induces the expression of miR-33 and miR-33* to impair xenophagy (the process by which cells eliminate intracellular pathogens) and promote fatty acid stores in lipid bodies, which helps the bacteria survive inside host cells. Additionally, miR-33 is involved in regulating cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and fatty acid metabolism. The pathway is also implicated in myocardial regeneration and repair, as well as in the pathogenesis of myocardial fibrosis.\n"
