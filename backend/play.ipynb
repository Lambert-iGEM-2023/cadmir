Radiotherapy and chemotherapy give cancer patients a signiÔ¨Åcantly improved chance of survival. Unfortunately, these methods have a huge impact on the cardiovascular system. MiRs, as recently discovered potential key players in the regulation of cardiotoxicity, including miR-1 and miR-21, may have a role in managing undesired harmful eÔ¨Äects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy on the heart.

Consistent with these previous Ô¨Åndings, our data showed that miR-21 was markedly upreg- ulated in the plasma from patients with CHD compared with the controls. Besides, we also evaluated the functional role of miR-21 in CHD. Activation of endothelial cells and multiplication of VSMCs could induce the stenosis and occlusion of coronary artery wall, thereby aggravating the progression of CHD [35]. Thus, the eÔ¨Äects of miR-21 on cell proliferation and apoptosis in VSMCs were explored in this study. Our results demonstrated that miR-21 dramatically boost cell proliferation and signiÔ¨Åcantly repressed cell apo- ptosis in VSMCs.

      "miRNA-1 (miR-1) is a muscle-specific microRNA that plays a crucial role in various physiological and pathological processes. It is primarily expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscles and is involved in the development of embryonic stem cells and cardiomyocyte progenitor cells. MiR-1 is encoded by two distinct genes, miR-1-1 and miR-1-2, and exists in a cluster with miR-133. It regulates the expression of many cardiac transcription factors and signaling pathways, including myocardin, Nkx2.5, serum response factor (SRF), WNT, and FGF signaling pathways.\n",
      "\n",
      "Functionally, miR-1 is involved in the differentiation of cardiac precursor cells and the regulation of calcium cycling in muscle tissue. It has been shown to be released into the circulation via exosomes and activate myeloid progenitor cells, leading to a systemic response to myocardial injury. MiR-1 has also been extensively studied as a potential biomarker for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Meta-analyses have reported its diagnostic accuracy, with a sensitivity of 0.78 and specificity of 0.86. However, there are concerns about potential biases due to the heterogeneity of the studies.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of clinical significance, miR-1 has been implicated in various heart diseases. It may regulate cardiac arrhythmogenicity by repressing the expression of connexin and inward-rectifier potassium ion channels. Studies in rats and mice have shown that the circulating levels of miR-1 increase rapidly after myocardial infarction, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for cardiac injury. Additionally, miR-1 expression is linked to several transcription factors and target genes involved in cardiomyocyte calcium homeostasis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Current research on miR-1 focuses on further understanding its role in cardiac development and disease. Studies are investigating its potential as a therapeutic target for heart diseases, including dilated cardiomyopathy and aortic stenosis. Researchers are also exploring the mechanisms by which miR-1 regulates gene expression and its interaction with other microRNAs and signaling pathways.\n",

It is involved in the differentiation of cardiac precursor cells, regulation of calcium cycling, and systemic response to myocardial injury.
